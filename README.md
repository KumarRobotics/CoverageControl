## Introduction

Coverage control is the problem of navigating a robot swarm to collaboratively monitor features or a phenomenon of interest not known _a priori_.
The library provides a simulation environment, algorithms, and GNN-based architectures for the coverage control problem.

**Key features:**  
- The core library is written in `C++` and `CUDA` to handle large-scale simulations
- There are `python` bindings that interface with the core library
- Several Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT)-based algorithms (aka Lloyd's algorithms)
- Learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the coverage control problem is implemented in `PyTorch` and `PyTorch Geometric`

## Getting Started
The library is available as a `pip` package. To install the package, run the following command:
```bash
pip install coverage_control
```

See [Installation](https://kumarrobotics.github.io/CoverageControl/installation.html) for more details on installation.

See [Quick Start](https://kumarrobotics.github.io/CoverageControl/quick_start.html) guide for a quick introduction to the library.
